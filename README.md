Machine Learning - CampusX Practice Journey

![1_1Mz7cDDu5KG719ViqNyN-A@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed7c962-a9eb-465c-b041-d2952f2e834e)

This repository contains my personal implementations, notes, and practice work from the CampusX - 100 Days of Machine Learning series.

The purpose of this repo is to strengthen my ML foundations through hands-on coding, experimentation, and applying every concept on real datasets. Every notebook here has been written and explored by me while learning, revising, and extending the concepts taught in the series.

📄 About This Repository

This repo is purely for learning and experimentation. Every notebook is handwritten by me through step-by-step practice during the CampusX 100 Days of ML course. I continue to update it as I complete more topics or try additional datasets.
